## Design-Pattern-Lab-6

# Given the following design, implement it in Java. Note: 

1.	You may add more attributes or operations to a class if necessary. Specifically, you may use meaningful operations for FBI_Agent and CIA_Agent classes.
2.	Read textbook to see some example code snippets (pp. 170â€”174).
3.	Your testing code (FBIAgentApp or CIAAgentAPP) should demonstrate how limited number of agents are requested to process tasks (the number of tasks are greater than the number of agents)
